## 🔍 Scope of Commit

This log registers the full integrity of Module 04 (M04), encompassing all conceptual, theoretical, and computational contributions made from sections 4.0 through 4.4. All components have been checked for:

- Semantic consistency and conceptual depth
- Alignment with publication strategy for *Nature Human Behaviour*
- Verification of all `citekeys` in `references.bib`
- Integrity of symbolic triad: anchoring (α), curvature (κ), recursive entropy (𝓔ᵣ)

## ✅ Plagiarism and Originality Verification

- Tool used: [plagiarismcheck.org](https://plagiarismcheck.org)
- File analyzed: `M04_symbolic_epistemology.tex`
- Date of analysis: 2025-07-30
- Overall match: **4.88%** (entirely due to references and structural phrasing)
- AI content classification: low-to-moderate, confined to stylistic passages
- Plagiarism detected: **0%**

The entire module was verified and cleared for originality. All citations were attributed, references were validated in the `.bib`, and the structure adheres to modular, symbolic authorship.

This confirms M04's readiness for journal submission and DOI permanence.

## ✅ Editorial Integration Log — Peer Review Expansion (2025-07-30)

Following a rigorous internal peer review modeled after *Nature Human Behaviour* standards, the following targeted expansions were integrated:

- 📍 Section 4.3.3 — Added a full symbolic simulation of cognitive bifurcation under entropy/anchoring shifts, including phase-state diagnostics.
- 📍 Section 4.4.3 — Introduced typology of cognitive singularities with clinical parallels (insight, psychosis, identity reconstruction).
- 📍 Section 4.4.4 — Specified potential visualization tools and mapping strategies using UMAP, TDA, and symbolic embeddings.
- 📚 All citations validated: `blackburn2015telomeres`, `baum2017twiceexceptional`, `neihart2002profiles`, `gergen2009narrative`, `lopezotin2013hallmarks`.

✅ This version (M04_v1.1) is now fully aligned with submission expectations of Q1 journals and Zenodo archival guidelines.
