# ✅ Commit Log — M03 Bibliographic Integrity and Completion

## Scope
This commit finalizes the bibliographic infrastructure of Module M03 — *Symbolic Modeling of Mental States*. All citations from Sections 3.1 through 3.4 have been cross-verified against the `references.bib` file, corrected for citation key alignment, and supplemented with missing canonical sources.

## Actions Performed
- 🧩 Validated 22 unique references actively cited in text.
- 🔍 Identified and resolved citekey inconsistencies across `M03_symbolic_modeling.tex`.
- ✅ Inserted the following missing references:
  - Rapp & Babloyantz (1985) — nonlinear brain dynamics [`rapp1985`]
  - Goldberger et al. (2002) — complexity and aging [`goldberger2002`]
  - Deleuze (1993) — symbolic curvature and fold theory [`deleuze1993`]
  - Liantinis (1993) — symbolic entropy and Greek tragic logic [`liantinis1993`]
- 📌 Confirmed all citations now use correct `\cite{}` syntax compatible with `biblatex`.
- 📚 Confirmed compatibility with Overleaf and Zotero export pipeline.

## Files Affected
- `references.bib`
- `sections/M03_symbolic_modeling.tex`

## DOI Preparation
This version of the bibliography supports the complete integrity of M03 for:
- 📤 GitHub commit and tag
- 🗂️ Zenodo versioning with DOI
- 📑 PDF export with embedded citation structure

## Next
Proceed to M04 or begin submission formatting pipeline.
