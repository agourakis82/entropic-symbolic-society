description: >
  This is the structured manuscript derived from the modular theory 'The Fractal Nature of an Entropically-Driven Society'.
  It consolidates symbolic manifold modeling, entropy-based dynamics, and neurocognitive regimes in a topology of mental states.
  This submission represents the unified trajectory targeting publication in *Nature Human Behaviour*, with full versioning and simulation traceability.
