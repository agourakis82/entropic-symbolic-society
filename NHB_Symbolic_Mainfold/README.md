# Symbolic Manifolds and Entropic Dynamics: A Cognitive Topology of Mental States

This repository contains the finalized manuscript and simulation framework derived from the modular research project *The Fractal Nature of an Entropically-Driven Society*. It is dedicated to the submission version structured specifically for *Nature Human Behaviour* under the symbolic manifold formulation.

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Scope

This work integrates entropy, symbolic cognition, neurodiversity, and topological modeling to simulate cognitive trajectories $\gamma(t) = (\alpha, \kappa, E_r)$. It introduces symbolic regime maps, bifurcation simulations, and comparative epistemological analysis with FEP, Entropic Brain, and Borsboomâ€™s frameworks.

## ðŸ§  Simulation Modules

All simulation scripts are located under `code/`. Figures are saved in `figs/` and compiled outputs in LaTeX under `main_modular_clean.tex`.
