title: "M02_entropy_vector — Entropy as a Fractal Organizing Vector"
upload_type: publication
publication_type: other
description: |
  This second modular entry deepens the symbolic, clinical, and topological framing of entropy as a fractal organizing vector. It articulates how recursive entropy dynamics manifest in trauma, giftedness, psychiatric collapse, and symbolic cognition. Module M02 sets the stage for formal modeling (M03) by integrating phenomenological, neurobiological, and thermodynamic dimensions of symbolic behavior.

title: "M03_symbolic_modeling — Symbolic Modeling of Mental States: Entropic Dynamics, Tensorial Geometry, and Diagnostic Topology"
upload_type: publication
publication_type: other
description: |
  This third modular entry formalizes the symbolic modeling of mental states as recursive, entropically modulated configurations within a socio-symbolic manifold. It introduces symbolic wavefunctions, tensorial curvature, and diagnostic topology as tools to reinterpret psychiatric states, giftedness, and singularities of cognition. M03 serves as the conceptual core of the entropic-symbolic project and prepares the epistemological basis for computational modeling in M04.
