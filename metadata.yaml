upload_type: publication
publication_type: other
description: |
  This second modular entry deepens the symbolic, clinical, and topological framing of entropy as a fractal organizing vector. It articulates how recursive entropy dynamics manifest in trauma, giftedness, psychiatric collapse, and symbolic cognition. Module M02 sets the stage for formal modeling (M03) by integrating phenomenological, neurobiological, and thermodynamic dimensions of symbolic behavior.

title: "M03_symbolic_modeling — Symbolic Modeling of Mental States: Entropic Dynamics, Tensorial Geometry, and Diagnostic Topology"
upload_type: publication
publication_type: other
description: |
  This third modular entry formalizes the symbolic modeling of mental states as recursive, entropically modulated configurations within a socio-symbolic manifold. It introduces symbolic wavefunctions, tensorial curvature, and diagnostic topology as tools to reinterpret psychiatric states, giftedness, and singularities of cognition. M03 serves as the conceptual core of the entropic-symbolic project and prepares the epistemological basis for computational modeling in M04.

title: "M04_symbolic_epistemology — Symbolic Epistemology and Recursive Cognition: Anchoring, Entropy, and Topological Dynamics"
upload_type: publication
publication_type: other
description: |
  This revised version incorporates all editorial recommendations following an internal peer review modeled after *Nature Human Behaviour*. The module deepens its theoretical articulation of symbolic epistemology by introducing simulations of symbolic bifurcation, diagnostic typologies of cognitive singularities (e.g., insight, psychosis, identity collapse), and cartographic modeling via TDA. Together, these layers solidify the module as a computational and epistemic backbone for mapping fractal cognition.

version: M04_v1.2

notes: >
  This entry finalizes the epistemological architecture of the entropic-symbolic-society project and bridges into computational cognitive modeling. It includes formal diagnostics, symbolic forecasting, topological representations of cognitive singularities, and culminates with the foundational epistemic thesis that cognition is recursive navigation through a curved semantic manifold.

title: "M05_symbolic_clinical_translation — Symbolic Collapse, Recovery, and Computational Trajectories in Clinical Psychiatry"
upload_type: publication
publication_type: other
description: |
  This module introduces a symbolic-clinical framework for understanding psychiatric collapse and reorganization through the lens of entropic dynamics. It incorporates formal models of symbolic deviation γ(t), entropic curvature (κ), anchoring coefficients (α), and recovery vectors in phase space. The work integrates deep clinical phenomenology with computational psychiatry, including NLP-based entropy metrics, recurrence quantification, and topological state transitions. The module closes with an implemented simulation and pseudocode to illustrate the dynamical modeling of symbolic states in high-entropy conditions.

description: |
  This sixth module deepens the entropic-symbolic framework by simulating symbolic trajectories and modeling epistemic singularities via vector fields in symbolic phase space. It introduces dynamic models of γ(t), collapse/recovery vectors, recursive entropy topographies, and diagnostic simulations of twice-exceptionality. The module includes reproducible Python code and formalizes epistemic attractors, bifurcations, and symbolic flow lines across anchoring and curvature gradients.
