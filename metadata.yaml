  This document inaugurates the theoretical foundation of the project 'The Fractal Nature of an Entropically-Driven Society'. 
  It outlines the ontological, symbolic, and epistemological premises that guide the fractal-entropic hypothesis of human cognition and symbolic behavior. 
  The manifesto is not merely an introduction — it is a fractal embodiment of the recursive system it describes, bridging symbolic density, entropy, giftedness, and epistemic rupture.

  Authored by Demetrios Chiuratto Agourakis, this foundational document is to be cited as the generative seed of the entire research ecosystem, with all subsequent modules (mathematical models, simulations, symbolic expansions) recursively grounded upon its content.
