# ✅ Final Commit — M03: Symbolic Modeling of Mental States

## Module: M03_symbolic_modeling.tex  
**Title:** Symbolic Modeling of Mental States: Entropic Dynamics, Tensorial Geometry, and Diagnostic Topology

---

## 🔍 Scope  
This commit finalizes the entire structure, argumentation, citation integration, and editorial polish of Module M03. It presents a formal, symbolic-physical framework for modeling mental states as recursive, entropically modulated topological configurations. The module has been edited for fluency, strategic density, epistemological balance, and submission-readiness to *Nature Human Behaviour*.

## ✅ Contents and Structure
- **3.1** — *Fractal States and the Entropic Continuum of Mental Singularities*: A symbolic-entropic reinterpretation of psychopathology and giftedness as attractors on a recursive manifold.  
- **3.2** — *Symbolic Schrödinger Dynamics of Mental States*: Formalization of symbolic recursion using an entropic analog of the Schrödinger equation, with safeguards against reductive metaphoricity.  
- **3.3** — *Tensorial Model of Symbolic Curvature and Collapse*: Proposal of a symbolic curvature tensor \( \mathcal{S}_{\mu\nu} \) as a topological operator for modeling psychiatric singularities.  
- **3.4** — *Diagnostic Topology and the Entropic Mapping of Mental States*: Construction of a phase-space for subjectivity via coordinates \( (S_s, R_s, C_s) \) with editorial closure and computational foresight.

## 🧠 Intellectual Contributions
- Synthesizes symbolic cognition, complex systems, psychiatric nosology, and mathematical modeling.  
- Introduces novel constructs such as symbolic wavefunctions, curvature tensors, and diagnostic phase-spaces.  
- Frames superdotação and psychosis as topological states, not static clinical categories.  
- Prepares semantic ground for empirical modeling in M04.
