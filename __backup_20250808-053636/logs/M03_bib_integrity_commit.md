# ✅ Commit Log — M03 Reference Integrity: Sections 3.1 & 3.2

## Scope
This commit consolidates the bibliographic integrity of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 from Module M03. All references cited in the body of the symbolic-entropic framework have been cross-validated against the `references.bib` master file and the Zotero library.

## Actions Performed
- Verified existence and format of 18 unique references.
- Detected and resolved duplicate entries for `Bateson1979` (*Mind and Nature*) by retaining only the authoritative 1979 edition.
- Confirmed integration of key theoretical sources:
  - Symbolic recursion and semiotics: Lotman (1990), Deacon (2011)
  - Free-energy principle and cognition: Friston (2010)
  - Network theory and psychiatric complexity: Borsboom (2017), Hernández et al. (2023)
  - Giftedness, sensitivity, and recursion: Silverman (2009), Rinn & Reynolds (2012)
  - Entropy and psychedelic state modeling: Carhart-Harris et al. (2014), Tagliazucchi et al. (2016)
- ✅ Added two missing references:
  - Rapp & Babloyantz (1985) — nonlinear brain dynamics
  - Goldberger et al. (2002) — physiologic complexity theory

## Files Affected
- `references.bib`
- Sections: `M03_symbolic_modeling.tex` — Subsections 3.1 and 3.2

## Ready For
- Git commit tracking  
- Synchronization with Zotero and Overleaf  
- DOI archival in Zenodo
