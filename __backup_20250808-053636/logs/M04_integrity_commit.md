## üîç Scope of Commit

This log registers the full integrity of Module 04 (M04), encompassing all conceptual, theoretical, and computational contributions made from sections 4.0 through 4.4. All components have been checked for:

- Semantic consistency and conceptual depth
- Alignment with publication strategy for *Nature Human Behaviour*
- Verification of all `citekeys` in `references.bib`
- Integrity of symbolic triad: anchoring (Œ±), curvature (Œ∫), recursive entropy (ùìî·µ£)

- **4.1** ‚Äì *Conceptual Foundations of Symbolic Epistemology*
- **4.2** ‚Äì *Measurement, Anchoring, and Semantic Phase States*  
  - 4.2.1 Epistemic Anchoring  
  - 4.2.2 Symbolic Curvature  
  - 4.2.3 Recursive Entropy  
  - 4.2.4 Semantic Phase States

## üßæ Notes

- All BibTeX entries validated and cross-checked.
- Citation style maintained consistently throughout (`\cite{}`).
- File `references.bib` synchronized with Zotero using Better BibTeX.
- Diagrammatic and simulation-based modules to follow in M05.
