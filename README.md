# 🧠 The Fractal Nature of an Entropically-Driven Society

> A symbolic-cognitive and mathematical exploration of societal organization under recursive entropic tension.

## ✳️ Overview

This repository hosts the modular research ecosystem of the project *The Fractal Nature of an Entropically-Driven Society*, authored by **Demetrios Chiuratto Agourakis**.  
It proposes a groundbreaking epistemological framework uniting:

- Fractal geometry
- Entropy and symbolic organization
- Neurocognition and giftedness
- Topologies of consciousness and trauma
- Formal models of symbolic space

The work is developed in modular stages, each published with its own DOI, source code, LaTeX source, and commentary. This is a living repository — it grows, folds, and reorganizes itself as the research evolves.

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

Each component of the project is developed as an autonomous yet interrelated module:

| Module | Title | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `M01_context` | [Foundational Manifesto](https://doi.org/10.xxxx/zenodo.xxx) | Ontological and symbolic foundation of the project |
| `M02_secaoX` | Section refinements | Recursive rewriting of core conceptual sections |
| `M03_modelo_mat` | Mathematical formalization | Symbolic Schrödinger model and entropy dynamics |
| `M04_simulacoes` | Simulations and visualizations | Monte Carlo, fractal propagation, symbolic fields |
| `M05_dados_empiricos` | Neuroscientific parallels | Giftedness, cortical fractality, symbolic rupture |
| `M06_interface_superdotacao` | Paradigm shift proposal | Giftedness as singular density in symbolic space |
| `M07_dialogos` | Registered dialogues | Metacognitive logs as trace of co-emergence |
| `M08_publicacao` | Submission preparation | Manuscript assembly, cover letters, final PDF |

All modules are versioned, archived, and cited via Zenodo with open access.

## 📌 Foundation: M01_context Manifesto

> “This text is not a theory. It is society folding into language. It breathes.”

The foundational manifesto that anchors this entire project — epistemologically, structurally, and symbolically — is available at:
