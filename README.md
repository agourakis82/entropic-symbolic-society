## ✳️ Overview

This repository hosts the modular research ecosystem of the project *The Fractal Nature of an Entropically-Driven Society*, authored by **Demetrios Chiuratto Agourakis**.  
It proposes a groundbreaking epistemological framework uniting:

- Fractal geometry
- Entropy and symbolic organization
- Neurocognition and giftedness
- Topologies of consciousness and trauma
- Formal models of symbolic space

The work is developed in modular stages, each published with its own DOI, source code, LaTeX source, and commentary. This is a living repository — it grows, folds, and reorganizes itself as the research evolves.

## 📌 Foundation: M01_context Manifesto

> “This text is not a theory. It is society folding into language. It breathes.”

## ♻️ Module M02 — Entropy as a Fractal Organizing Vector

> “Entropy is not disorder. It is recursive possibility folding into form.”

## 🧠 Module M04 — Symbolic Epistemology and Recursive Cognition

> “Anchoring is what prevents symbolic collapse. Curvature is what lets it explore. Entropy is what makes it evolve.”

🔗 **[M04 DOI — Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16619481)**  
📄 `sections/M04_symbolic_epistemology.tex`

This module expands the theoretical framework of symbolic epistemology by introducing formal metrics for epistemic anchoring (α), symbolic curvature (κ), and recursive entropy (𝓔ᵣ).  
It formalizes symbolic phase-state theory, predictive symbolic modeling, and the topology of cognitive singularities such as insight, psychosis, and superdotation.  
It culminates in the construction of an epistemic-symbolic cartography using topological data analysis (TDA) and phase-space bifurcation modeling.  
> 🧾 This revised version (M04_v1.2, DOI [10.5281/zenodo.16619481](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16619481)) integrates all recommendations from triple peer-review simulation across neuroscience, epistemology, and psychiatry, including epistemic closure, symbolic collapse modeling, and coordination dynamics citations.

> 🔎 This module was validated using plagiarismcheck.org and returned **0% plagiarism**, confirming its originality and integrity for peer-reviewed submission.
