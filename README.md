## 🧠 Module M06 — Symbolic Profiles of Cognitive Singularity

> “Singularity is not a rupture. It is the recursive excess of order escaping the symbolic frame.”

This module expands the symbolic-clinical framework through entropic simulation of symbolic deviation γ(t), modeling epistemic collapse, recovery, and twice-exceptional (2e) profiles.  
It introduces the epistemic field $\vec{v}(\alpha, \kappa)$ derived from recursive entropy, visualizes symbolic attractors and bifurcations, and proposes formal diagnostic signatures in symbolic space.  
Two figures and two Python scripts reproduce symbolic dynamics and entropy-driven topologies.
